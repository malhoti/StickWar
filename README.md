This is for my Final Year Project

Stick War with Reinforcement Learning

Implented PPO and DQN Reinforcement Learning algorithms to play the game

Stick War Environment has the Unity code
Stick War Agents has the python code, including the server, RL model code.

# Unity 2022.3.30f1
If you wish to run this, clone this first.
then on unity hub, download the same unity version and add project.
select this clone and it should start re-building the necessary folder automatically for you.

# To excecute RL models to play
change the apporopraite model paths in the server.py and run it

and in unity scene under global variables, enable rl connection
under each team enable the rl agents components and select if you want them under eval mode or train mode
you can also specifiy if you want dqn or ppo with model type
